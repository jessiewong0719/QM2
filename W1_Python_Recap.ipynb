No longer does the English commentary injected into a program have to be hidden in comment delimiters at the top of the file, or under procedure headings, or at the end of lines. Instead, it is wrenched into the daylight and made the main focus. The \"program\" then becomes primarily a document directed at humans, with the code being herded between \"code delimiters\" from where it can be extracted and shuffled out sideways to the language system by literate programming tools.\n",
